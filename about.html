            <p class="txt">The Scindia School is situated on the top of the Gwalior fort which is considered by many as the best boarding schools for boys in India. The school believes in modernization along with valuing the Indian culture. . Scindia being a boarding school offers a lot to learn. The school helps the student grow in the field of academics, extracurricular activities, and sports. Personality development is also a part of the school’s curriculum as looking at a Scindian speaks “class”.   
                The Scindia School, located atop a rock plateau with its 120 acres (about twice the area of The Vatican) of lush, diverse communities of flora and fauna is one of the best places in our country where students get the opportunity to co-exist with nature and deepen their interactions with the natural world. Over the years, with the engagement of children of different age groups that reside and study at our school, we have focused on promoting sustainable goals in the field of water conservation and preservation of plant and animal life.</p>
