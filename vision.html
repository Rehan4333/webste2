          <h1>Our Vision</h1>
          <p class="vsn_para">We created the G-Band for institutions such as schools with the aim of ensuring health and security of the child and individuals with conditions that demand such technology. The band is equipped with the latest GPS III chip which sends after every 5 minutes. To enhance the use of this band, Infinity has decided to develop a software which will record attendance. This will replace the traditional attendance system with a system that is much more efficient and time saving. Therefore, the band is Wi-Fi enabled. 

 

            Use of G-Band is not just limited to the workspace. Instead, it can be used anywhere. The Infinity G-Band app establishes a connection between your band and the app. Now one can easily monitor the location of the person wearing it. The location will update after every 5 minutes and can be stored in different cloud platforms such Google Drive and One Drive.  
            
             
            
            Location tracking is just a mere feature of this band. The band is equipped with many health trackers such as sleep tracker, SpO2, pulse counter to name a few. This health data could be viewed easily through the Infinity G-Band app.  
            
             
            
            The band will help making the bond between the student, teacher, parent and, the management more cohesive. The Infinity G-Band for commercial use makes the management of the data even more efficient. All the bands come with a 1-year warranty.  
            
             
            
            Along with personal and commercial use, we also have a developer version of G-Band. This version has all the features enabled and budding developers could try and make this exemplary project even better.  </p>
